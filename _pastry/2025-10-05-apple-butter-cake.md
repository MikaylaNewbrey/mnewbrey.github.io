excerpt: "Notes on replacing banana with apple butter in a brown-butter loaf that can’t decide if it’s bread or cake."

This loaf is unapologetically autumnal. I stopped by Scott Farm this weekend and couldn’t resist their apple butter. Left with a few jars and, naturally, too many apples. This recipe doesn’t call for fresh ones (they’re destined for a Gâteau Invisible), but if you’re that kind of person, go ahead and fold some in. It’ll only make your kitchen smell better.

### **Method**

1. Preheat oven to **350°F (175°C)**.  
2. Butter a 9×5" loaf pan and line it with parchment, leaving an overhang for easy removal.  
3. In a small saucepan, **brown the butter** until nutty and fragrant. Let it cool slightly.  
4. In a large bowl, whisk together **apple butter**, **pumpkin purée**, **brown sugar**, **browned butter**, **eggs**, and **vanilla** until smooth.  
5. In another bowl, whisk **flour**, **baking soda**, **salt**, and **spices**.  
6. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined—don’t overmix.  
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for **about 70 minutes**, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  
8. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then lift out and let cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.

### **Notes**
