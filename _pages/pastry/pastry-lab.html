  <p>Welcome to my other lab — the kitchen. Baking, much like research, is about curiosity, experimentation, and patience (with a little less data cleaning). 
  This page documents my pastry experiments: what worked, what didn’t, and what’s still in the oven. Each entry includes recipe notes, photos, and reflections on process and technique.</p>

  <h2>Latest Experiments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/pastry-lab/croissant-trials/">Croissant Trials: Variables in Lamination and Proofing</a></li>

  <p>Like any good lab, this one is open access. Feel free to browse, replicate, and improve upon these edible experiments.</p>
